AI-Driven Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Optimization

This repository implements a cutting-edge Software-Defined Networking (SDN) framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically optimize and prioritize network traffic flows. By integrating machine learning-driven automation, the system intelligently adapts to real-time network conditions, enhancing Quality of Service (QoS), minimizing latency, and maximizing throughput.

Key Features:

Intelligent Traffic Engineering: Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn optimal routing policies in dynamic network environments.

Self-Learning Network Control: Continuously refines traffic prioritization through adaptive AI models, improving efficiency without manual intervention.

Scalable SDN Architecture: Built on a programmable networking stack, enabling real-time analytics and data-driven decision-making.

End-to-End Optimization: Dynamically balances load, mitigates congestion, and ensures high-performance data flow between hosts.

Ideal for next-gen network automation, AI-powered infrastructure, and research in autonomous networking. Contributions and collaborations welcome!
